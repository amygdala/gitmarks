   <p align="center"><img src="images/Spring.jpg" alt="Spring" height="195" width="300" /></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">For
many years I worked in palliative care. My patients were those who had
gone home to die. Some incredibly special times were shared. I was with
them for the last three to twelve weeks of their lives.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">People
grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality. I learnt never
to underestimate someone's capacity for growth. Some changes were
phenomenal. Each experienced a variety of emotions, as expected,
denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually acceptance.
Every single patient found their peace before they departed though,
every one of them.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">When
questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do
differently, common themes surfaced again and again. Here are the most
common five:</font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">1. <u>I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.</u></font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">This
was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their life
is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many
dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honoured even a half
of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they
had made, or not made.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">It
is very important to try and honour at least some of your dreams along
the way. From the moment that you lose your health, it is too late.
Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer have it.</font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">2. <u>I wish I didn't work so hard. </u></font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">This
came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their
children's youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of
this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the
female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed
deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a
work existence.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">By
simplifying your lifestyle and making conscious choices along the way,
it is possible to not need the income that you think you do. And by
creating more space in your life, you become happier and more open to
new opportunities, ones more suited to your new lifestyle. </font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">3. <u>I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.</u></font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">Many
people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. As
a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who
they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed illnesses relating
to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">We
cannot control the reactions of others. However, although people may
initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly,
in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier
level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your
life. Either way, you win.</font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">4. <u>I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</u></font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">Often
they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until
their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down.
Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let
golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets
about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved.
Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.</font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">It
is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip. But
when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details of
life fall away. People do want to get their financial affairs in order
if possible. But it is not money or status that holds the true
importance for them. They want to get things in order more for the
benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and weary
to ever manage this task. It is all comes down to love and
relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final weeks,
love and relationships.</font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">5. <u>I wish that I had let myself be happier.</u></font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">This
is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that
happiness is a choice.&nbsp; They had stayed stuck in old patterns and
habits. The so-called 'comfort' of familiarity overflowed into their
emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them
pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When
deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their
life again. </font></p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">When you
are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way from your
mind. How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again, long before
you are dying. </font></p>
   <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="justify"><font size="2">Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose honestly. Choose happiness.</font></p>
